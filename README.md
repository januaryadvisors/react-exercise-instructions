## React Exercises

In these two exercises, you'll be asked to add a few missing features to a sample React application. The exercises are intended to take no more than 30 minutes each. Although you will have a day to complete them, please do not spend more than an hour on them! We don't want to take up an excess of your time. 

If you don't complete the exercises, please simply submit your partial solutions! :)

## Prerequisites / Expectations

These exercises are intended for someone that has ...
- Experience with React and HTML/CSS/JS
- Has `npm` configured on their computer (to run the commands listed in "Setup")

## Setup

Open the project zip file that we sent to you along with these instructions on your computer.
Once in the project directory, run `npm install .` to install all node modules.

To start your local server, run `npm start`. You should see the app running at `http://localhost:3000/`!

For both exercises, you'll be asked to edit code in the [components](https://github.com/januaryadvisors/react-exercises/tree/main/src/components) folder of our repository, which is what you'll submit via Google Drive.

## Exercise 1 - Fruit List

Once you have your local project running, please navigate to the `/src/components/Fruit.js` file. This is where you will add your code!

For this exercise, please display all the fruit listed in `fruitList` in a tile format, where each tile displays the name, description, and image of a fruit in the list. Your code should ideally use `fruitList` in such a way that the contents of `fruitList` could change (e.g. another fruit object is added following the same format) and your solution still works.

Feel free to make additional components if you would like, but you shouldn't need to make edits to files outside of the `components` folder.

**Target result (doesn't have to look exactly like this, but general layout should ideally be similar!)**

## Exercise 2 - Vegetable Search

Once you have your local project running, please navigate to your copy of the `/src/components/Vegetables.js` file. This is where you will add your code!

For this exercise, please update the code so that the text input acts as a search bar for the vegetables shown below. As you type into the search bar, only the vegetables that match the search should be displayed. The search bar should work even if the capitalization doesn't match. See the following GIF for an example of the behavior.

## Submitting

Please zip/compress your edited `components` folder and upload it to the Google Drive folder we shared with you. If you happened to make edits to any other files, please send us those as well.

Thank you very much for taking the time to participate! If you have any questions, feel free to email `emi@januaryadvisors.com` and `kelsey@januaryadvisors.com`.
